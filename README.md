This app requires a piece of hardware called the CAT Clutch and WILL NOT work without this external hardware. 

PIXEL Editor is a modified version of the popular Android pixel editor app, Pixelesque, that is integrated with the CAT Clutch LED purse.

Special thanks for RJ Marsan for making this wonderful pixel edtior app available.
